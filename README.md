# Mushroom_Class
Prediction Modeling Project Using Mushroom Classification Data
The Mushroom Dataset used for this project was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
I have re-formatted and attached all the sourced data as .csv files. These can be found in the Data folder.
The Data-Visualizations Folder contains .png files for all the visualizations made during my EDA.
The Mushroom_Classification_Workflow notebook contains all the steps for my project from Data Cleaning and EDA, to Feature Engineering and Modeling.
